# **Instacap-RS**
## The Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis project involves several key components and processes:
### Data Flow & Processing
**1. Network Monitoring**

Captures live network packets from network interfaces
Parses protocols (HTTP, DNS, SSL, TCP, UDP)
Extracts metadata like IPs, ports, bytes transferred, connection states

**2. Stream Processing Pipeline**

Real-time data ingestion through Kafka message queues
High-performance data processing in Rust
Asynchronous processing of thousands of network events per second

**3. Machine Learning Analysis**

Feature extraction from network patterns
Anomaly detection using statistical models
Risk scoring based on traffic characteristics
Pattern recognition for known attack signatures

#### Technical Components
**_Infrastructure:_**

Docker containers for easy deployment
Kafka for handling high-throughput data streams
Elasticsearch as a time-series database
Message queues and event-driven architecture

**_Security Analysis:_**

Detects unusual traffic patterns (data exfiltration, port scanning)
Identifies potential brute force attacks
Flags suspicious protocol usage
Monitors for malware communication patterns

**_Visualization & Alerting:_**

Real-time dashboards showing network health
Traffic volume analysis and trending
Geographic mapping of connections
Automated alerts for high-risk events
